# Cords
Code based on [https://www.openprocessing.org/sketch/389857](https://www.openprocessing.org/sketch/389857)

Originally written in Processing I have refactored it to be a class in Javascript. I have made the resulting image look closer and more recognisable to the input image, and the algorithm is no longer based on random numbers.

I have attempted to add colour by two different methods but the resulting images didn't look very good, as such I haven't included a colour option.
